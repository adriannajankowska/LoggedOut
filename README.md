Logged Out

This repository consists only of C# scripts from my video game Logged Out. 

"Logged Out" is my private project of a video game made in Unity on which I've been working for almost 2 years. It's an immersive photorealistic first-person story-driven mystery game with a curious puzzle to solve. The game development demanded a diverse skill set, including C# programming, game design, level design, sound design (Adobe Audition), gameplay engineering, UX design (Adobe Photoshop), creating custom shaders (Unity shader graph), setting lighting on the scene, 3D modeling and texturing (Autodesk Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter), generating models using photogrammetry (Agisoft Metashape), generating procedural assets (Houdini), and testing, among other aspects. This comprehensive approach allowed me to gain insights into the entire game development process, from conceptualization to execution.
